...MARKET MOVING NEWS! (07/06/24)

1️⃣ Telegram Launches Digital Mini-App Payment System, Telegram Stars ✨

Pavel Durov, CEO of the messaging platform Telegram, has announced the launch of ‘Telegram Stars’ - a new payment system for digital goods and services via in-app purchases on iOS and Android. Notably, Durov stated that app developers can swap their stars for TON via the exchange Fragment. 

Explaining Telegram Stars’ compliance strategy for Apple and Google's digital product sale policies, Durov wrote,

Apple and Google take a 30% cut when users buy Stars from them, but Telegram will subsidise ads purchased with Telegram Stars. So if developers reinvest Stars in promoting their app, the overall commission will be nearly 0%. As a result, launching apps on Telegram makes more economic sense than launching traditional mobile apps.

### Conceptual Design
1. **Define the Use Case**: Determine the specific scenario where offline transactions are needed. This could be in areas with unreliable internet, during natural disasters, or for privacy concerns.
2. **Select the Blockchain Platform**: Choose a blockchain that supports your requirements. For offline transactions, platforms like Bitcoin's Lightning Network, Ethereum with State Channels, or specialized blockchains like Celo could be considered.

### Technical Implementation
#### 1. **Architecture Design**
- **State Channels**: Enable parties to conduct multiple transactions off-chain and only commit the final state to the blockchain.
- **Sidechains**: Use sidechains for handling transactions that can periodically synchronize with the main chain.
- **Mesh Networks**: Utilize mesh networks for communication between devices in a decentralized manner.

#### 2. **Smart Contract Development**
- **Create Smart Contracts**: Develop smart contracts to manage transaction states, security, and final settlement on the main chain.
- **Deployment**: Deploy smart contracts on the chosen blockchain.

#### 3. **Backend Development**
- **Node Setup**: Set up blockchain nodes to interact with your smart contracts.
- **Off-chain Infrastructure**: Build servers to manage off-chain transaction logic and communication with user devices.

#### 4. **Frontend Development**
- **User Interface**: Design and develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the dapp.
- **Wallet Integration**: Integrate wallets to enable users to manage their funds and transactions.

#### 5. **Offline Transaction Mechanism**
- **Transaction Signing**: Allow users to sign transactions offline and broadcast them later when they are back online.
- **QR Codes/NFC**: Utilize QR codes or NFC for transaction data transfer between devices.

### Steps for Implementation
1. **Set Up Development Environment**
    - Install necessary tools like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix for Ethereum development.
    - Set up a local blockchain for testing using Ganache or a testnet like Ropsten.

2. **Develop and Deploy Smart Contracts**
    - Write smart contracts in Solidity (for Ethereum) or the language specific to your blockchain.
    - Deploy contracts using development frameworks (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat).

3. **Build Backend Services**
    - Create APIs to interact with smart contracts.
    - Set up a database to store transaction states and user data.

4. **Develop the Frontend**
    - Use frameworks like React or Vue.js for the frontend.
    - Integrate with wallets like MetaMask or custom-built wallets to handle offline signing.

5. **Enable Offline Capabilities**
    - Implement transaction signing and storage on the user’s device.
    - Use QR codes/NFC for transaction data exchange.
    - Ensure the application can broadcast transactions once the device is back online.

6. **Testing and Deployment**
    - Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.
    - Deploy the dapp to a public blockchain network.

7. **User Education and Support**
    - Provide clear instructions for users on how to perform offline transactions.
    - Set up support channels to assist users with any issues.

### Example Workflow for Offline Transaction
1. **User A wants to send funds to User B offline:**
    - User A inputs transaction details in the dapp.
    - The dapp generates a signed transaction.
    - User A transfers the transaction to User B via QR code/NFC.
    - User B stores the transaction on their device.

2. **Once User B is back online:**
    - User B’s dapp broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain.
    - The transaction is confirmed, and the state is updated on-chain.
